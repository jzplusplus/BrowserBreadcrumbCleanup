# BrowserBreadcrumbCleanup

You tap on a link in an app. It opens Safari or Chrome with the webpage. You look through it and when you're done, you tap the back button in the top-left of the statusbar to go back to what you were doing. But now that browser tab is just sitting there!

This tweak automatically closes the tab when you tap the status bar "Back to..." button in Chrome or Safari.
